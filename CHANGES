Version         Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.2	* Released 150824

	* wmppp.app uses now the new library libdockapp that includes the old
	  wmgeneral library.

	* Add note about libdockapp to INSTALL.

1.3.1   * Released 150519

	* Now maintained by Window Maker Developers Team
	  <wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org>.

	* Update Free Software Foundation address and GPL2 text
	  in COPYING.

	* Remove getmodemspeed binary from source.

	* Remove trailing whitespace.

	* Add manpage (obtained from Debian package).

	* Rename system wide fixed options configuration file
	  for consistency.

	* Allow ISDN devices.
	  Users of ISDN dialup lines (such as me) cannot use
	  wmppp as shipped, because it rejects to use any
	  device except those beginning with `ppp'.
	  The patch attached solves this.
	  Based on the patch by Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org> [1].

	* Stampfile handling.
	  This patch adds support for "stampfile" in config
	  file, as described in manual page.
	  Based on the patch by Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org> [1].

	* Display speed in K when too high.
          When the download speed is too high, wmppp can't
	  display it because it has only 5 digit. The most
	  significant digits are hidden !
	  This small patch display the speed in K when it is
	  too high.
	  Based on the patch by jguiton <jguiton@free.fr> [2].

	* Use rm -f for make clean
	  This patch prevents "make clean" from failing when
	  the source tree is already clean.

	* Use build flags.
	  Compile with CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS and do not
	  overwrite CFLAGS.
	  This enables the Debian package to be built with
	  hardening options.  See [3].

	* Update to latest version of wmgeneral library.

	* Move source files to top directory.
	  This way, users need only type "make" to build
	  instead of needing to "cd wmppp" first.

	* Fix spelling mistakes.
	  Used codespell -w.

	* Reduce scope of several variables.
	  Fixes several "(style) The scope of the variable 'p'
	  can be reduced" found by cppcheck.

	* Switch ifs to #ifs for macros.
	  Fixes "warning: null argument where non-null
	  required" compiler warnings by not passing NULL to
	  strdup and "(warning) Conversion of string literal
	  to bool always evaluates to true" found by cppcheck.

	* Remove unused parameter from get_statistics().
	  Fixes "warning: unused parameter ‘devname’" compiler
	  warning.

	* Replace deprecated caddr_t cast with void*.

	* Replace deprecated usleep with nanosleep.

	* Remove C++ style comments.

	* Use #includes from include-what-you-use.
	  We actually include <sys/socket.h> instead of
	  <bits/socket_type.h>, as it returns an error: "Never
	  include <bits/socket_type.h> directly; use
	  <sys/socket.h> instead."

	* Update Makefile.  Main change is to use $(INSTALL)
	  instead of cp in install target along with $(DESTDIR)
	  variable.  We also remove installation of user
	  ~/.wmppprc config file -- this isn't useful for
	  sysadmins or package maintainers.
	  We also update INSTALL to reflect the changes.

	* Fix segfault when HOME undefined.
	  Instead, we exit with an error message.  This fixes Debian bug #716472
	  [4].

	* Fix segfault if stop_action or start_action strings are NULL.

	* Add new command line options.
	  We add command line options for the user to change the start, stop,
	  speed, ifdown, and stampfile settings at runtime.  This closes a
	  Debian wishlist bug [5].
	  Note that, in order to have the command line options overwrite the
	  defaults set in the configuration file, we split the command line
	  parsing code into a new function (parse_cmdline()).  We then merged
	  main() and wmppp_routine().
	  We document the new options in the help text and in the man page.  We
	  also take the opportunity to reformat the help text for the -i option
	  and add the -geometry option to the man page.

	* Reread configuration file.
	  Based in part on a patch by Chris Gray [6] to fix Debian bug #50181
	  [7].

	* Command line options take precedence over configuration files.
	  Since we now reread the configuration files on occasion, the options
	  given at the command line could be overwritten.  To avoid this, we
	  save the command line options and always use them if present.

1.3.0	* Released 980916

	* WMPPP is almost completely rewritten, WMPPP is now
	  also based on the WMGeneral code core;
	* WMPPP now parces arguments from it's rc files;
	* Major overall code cleanup;
	* Added a bytes/sec Speed-O-Meter;
	* Commandline option for loadgraph/meter update speed;
	* Added createXBMfromXPM (maskless .xpm);
	* Geometry support has been added (finally);
	* Some cosmetic changes to the GUI;
	* Multiple ppp devices support (EXPERIMENTAL!);
	* getmodemspeed.c now reads /etc/ppp/connect-errors,
	  and scans for both CARRIER and CONNECT;



1.2p1	* Released 980502

        * Updated the docs, sorry, we forgot to update some
          of them, due to some last minute changes in the code
          the docs where incorrect on some parts (systemrc).

        * Updated the Makefile because the systemrc files
          went to the wrong location (due to above changes).

        * Updated the WMPPP rc files, again, due to some last
          minute changes in the code, WMPPP's rc files where
          no longer working properly.


1.2	* Released 980429

	* Completely revamped the WMPPP & WMiFS GUI :)

	* Added 'forceleft, forcemiddle and forceright'
	  options in WMiFS for 'real' multiuser systems,
	  when 'force*' is detected in /etc/wmifsrc the
	  user settings in ~/.wmifsrc are overridden
	  (useful for sites where users may not fiddle
	   with pppd's options :)

	* WMPPP: Ditto, added 'force' facility here too

	* WMPPP: now correctly redisplays time when killed
          	 and restarted

	* WMPPP: timer now starts to run when the actual
		 connection is made

	* WMPPP: added BAUD CONNECT value display

	* WMPPP: added 'getmodemspeed', a SUID proggie to
	         read the CONNECT value from /var/log/messages

	* WMPPP: dropped the config GUI and added an
	         .wmppprc file instead > motivation to do so:
	         this way, WMPPP is much more platform and
	         distribution independent :)

	* WMPPP: enhanced the status LED, yellow means
	         dialing, green means online, red means error

	* WMPPP: added -display commandline option

	* WMPPP: added -t commandline option, default
	         the timer will display HH:MM, -t will display
	         MM:SS and switch to HH:MM after 60 minutes

	* WMiFS: added support for all interfaces in
	         /proc/net/, now all interfaces are supported :)

	* WMiFS: added -display commandline option

	* WMiFS: added -w commandline option, this will
	         draw the graph in our new 'waveform' look :)

	* WMiFS: fixed the coredump problems that occurred
	         on some systems with or without .wmifsrc file
	         typo's, errors, etc. in the .wmifsrc file are
	         now also being ignored/rejected, the worst
	         thing that can happen now is that the scripts
	         do not execute (i.e. luser error) ;-)

	* WMiFS: when monitoring a ppp interface, bytes
	         are used to draw the graph, otherwise packets

	* WMiFS: made the RX/TX/Status LED box identical
	         to the one in WMPPP, the right LED is the status
	         LED, green means interface is working, red means
	         error (interface down, NIC broken, etc.)
